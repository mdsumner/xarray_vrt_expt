##  Problem NetCDF files 

The dummy 'crs' variable exists to store projection info for the data in a NetCDF file. 

When xarray reads one dataset with `open_dataset()` it correctly sits on its own unused scalar dimension, but
with `open_mfdataset()` crs is on the 'time' dimension. This causes problems with append. 


(I cannot get this to work from the github URLs, so I'm just assuming you download some [from here](https://github.com/mdsumner/xarray_vrt_expt/tree/master/data/nsidc), or wget as here). 


```
wget https://github.com/mdsumner/xarray_vrt_expt/raw/master/data/nsidc/NSIDC0051_SEAICE_PS_S25km_20220522_v2.0.nc
wget https://github.com/mdsumner/xarray_vrt_expt/raw/master/data/nsidc/NSIDC0051_SEAICE_PS_S25km_20220523_v2.0.nc

```



This first example is correct, crs is on its own (not associated with time dimension). 

```{python open_dataset}
import xarray as xr 
xr.open_dataset('NSIDC0051_SEAICE_PS_S25km_20220522_v2.0.nc', engine = 'netcdf4')
```


Oops, crs is on time dimension. 

```{python open-multiple2}
## open two and crs is living on the time dimension
xr.open_mfdataset(['NSIDC0051_SEAICE_PS_S25km_20220522_v2.0.nc', 
                  'NSIDC0051_SEAICE_PS_S25km_20220523_v2.0.nc'], engine = 'netcdf4')

```


Ok when we only use one source. 

```{python open-multiple0}
## open 1 it doesn't happen
xr.open_mfdataset('NSIDC0051_SEAICE_PS_S25km_20220522_v2.0.nc', engine = 'netcdf4')
```

```{open open-multiple1}
xr.open_mfdataset(['NSIDC0051_SEAICE_PS_S25km_20220522_v2.0.nc'], engine = 'netcdf4')
```
